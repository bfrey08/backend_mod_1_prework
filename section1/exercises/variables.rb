# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
hp_warning = "Harry Potter must not return to Howarts!"
p hp_warning

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
p students + 2

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
p students - 2


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.

first_name = "Billy";
is_hungry = false;
number_of_pets = 1;
p number_of_pets, is_hungry, first_name


# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?

# Explain.

# I decide to use a string for first_name because a name would naturally be a collection
# of letters or numbers. I used a TrueClass for the second because this is either a yes
# or no answer. It is a more specific class type (Boolean). Finally I used an integer
# for number_of_pets as this would naturally be a whole number. By using the appropriate
# class I can now utilize these variables appropriately in future code.


# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "William";
is_hungry = true;
number_of_pets = 2;
p number_of_pets, is_hungry, first_name


# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

p junk_food_snacks + healthy_snacks

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?

  # Yes
