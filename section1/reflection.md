## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?  
  * The SuperLearners article resonated with me through the use of "mindsets". I feel I will be most successful when I adopt a learning and "growth" mindset.
  * I have already worked to adapt a growth mindset and I already read a lot.
  * While in my previous industry I have found a lot of success in teaching others what I know -- I will have to overcome a fear of being incorrect when it comes to collaborating and helping fellow students. I am also looking to adapt POM breaks to help keep my brain sharp.
  * Super learners take it one step at a time. Impossible task ahead? they break it down into one step processes. One tangible step forward after another.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?  
`#`

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
  * An integer is a whole value ex. 1,2,3,4,5 while a float can be a fraction of a number. Ex. 1.45
1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
```
animal = "zebra"
```
1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
```
puts animal
```
1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
  * Interpolation in this context would be when you insert a variable into a string. You can also insert snippets of code into a string using interpolation.
```
puts "The #(animal) had no stripes"
```

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
```
gets
```
1. Name and describe two common string methods:
  * `.split` and `.length` are two common string methods. The prior splits a string into multiple parts - it defualts to using a space to decide where to split the string. The latter returns the number of characters in a string (including space)
